# 🧠 Building Emotion-Aware Interfaces from Keyboard Data
---

## ✨ Why I'm Even Doing This

We interact with apps like machines — clicks, taps, keystrokes.  
But those tiny movements? They are emotional. They are **Data**.
And most apps completely ignore them.

So I’m building **Threadbrain**, a journaling-thought-mapping-AI-sidekick kinda thing, and this devlog is the first peek into the weird side of it:  

**Your keyboard is a mood detector.**

---

## ⌨️ Keystrokes Are Emotional Data

Let’s break it down.  
When you're stressed, anxious, deep in thought, or in the zone, your typing literally changes:

- You pause more  
- You spam backspace like you're in a video game 
- You type in short bursts, or long rants
- You slow down when you’re unsure **(Big Brain Moments)**

It’s all there. Hidden in plain text.  
These collectively, are called **Keystroke Dynamics** — and I’m using it to make interfaces *feel* more like they’re listening.

## 🧪 What Threadbrain Does with It

Threadbrain’s core idea is simple:

> “Capture thoughts + sense how you’re feeling when you type them.”

When you're journaling, Threadbrain tracks:

- **Typing speed** (wpm-ish)  
- **Pauses** (duration + frequency)  
- **Backspaces per sentence**  
- **Bursts vs. hesitation**  
- *or* -  a **mood slider**, if you wanna self-rate  

All of this gets bundled with your thoughts and piped into an **NLP Graph Pipeline**.

---

## 🔬 The Pipeline Looks Like This

Threadbrain follows a structured flow that transforms raw input into meaningful insights:

### 1. Frontend Data Capture 
The Flutter Application handles:

- Real-time typing + mood data

🖐️ You type. Threadbrain listens — not just to what you say, but how.

### 2. Behavioral Analytics
Typing Metrics Collection: 
- Keystroke rhythm, pause patterns, cognitive signals

⌨️ Your typing reveals more than your words. Threadbrain tries to decode the hidden signals.

### 3. Backend Processing Engine

The core processing stack handles:
- **Mood detection** 
- **Thought parsing**
- **Contextual linking**

🧪 A processing stack built to feel things. Godd!! sounds soo cool 😆

### 4. Graph Database Structure

Neo4j powers the relational memory.
- Connects emotions, people, topics, tasks

🧠 Your thoughts formed a friend group. Some got drama.

## Data Flow Summary

```
User Input → Typing Metrics → NLP Processing → Graph Storage → Insights
```

The result?  
A **growing, emotional thought graph**. That’s not just storing *what* you think — but *how you felt* when you wrote it.

---

## 🧘 UI That Reacts to You

Here’s where it gets really Interesting.
If Threadbrain detects you’re typing under stress *(lots of pauses, high backspace, short bursts)*, it adapts:

- Simplifies the UI  
- Boosts font size + contrast

Basically: *don’t overwhelm me bro, I’m barely holding on.*

This is what I mean by **Emotion-aware Interfaces**.  
UIs that **understand your energy**. No more one-size-fits-all static layouts.

---

## 🔮 Why This Might Actually Matter

This isn’t just some “cute” feature.  
It’s a shot at building systems that:

- Understand your **emotional patterns**  
- Help you **reflect more honestly**  
- Support **focus and mental health**, subtly  

Most journaling or productivity tools don’t really care about how you feel.  
**Threadbrain does** - because **emotions are data**, and ignoring them is just bad design.

---

## 👀 What’s Next

Right now, this is v0.  
I’m refining the stress detection heuristics, adding NLP sentiment analysis, and letting the graph evolve over time.

Eventually, I want Threadbrain to:

- Spot burnout trends before you do
- Connect thoughts based on emotional similarity  
- …maybe even become a mini-therapist 🤷

## 🫡 If You’re Still Reading

Appreciate you.  
This was the first of ( **hopefully** ) many devlogs as I build this chaotic, slightly self-aware thought system.

If you’ve ever:

- Felt emotionally out of sync with your tools  
- Wanted journaling to *do more*  
- Or just like the idea of teaching your keyboard to understand you...

**Hit me up. Let’s talk.**

Until next commit, hope you and your thoughts are getting along, friend.
