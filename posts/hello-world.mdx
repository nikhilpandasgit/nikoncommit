# yo. welcome to the chaos ðŸ‘‹

iâ€™m nik (well, Nikhil but isn't nik wayy cooler XD)  
this blog? itâ€™s my brain dumped on the internet. slightly organized. sometimes brilliant. usually caffeinated.

## why this even exists

honestly, i needed a place to **think out loud**. also:

1. **Clarity** â€” writing slows my brain down enough to actually *understand* what iâ€™m doing  
2. **Share the sauce** â€” if i learn something cool or painful, youâ€™re getting it raw  
3. **Connect** â€” youâ€™re not the only one making it up as you go. letâ€™s do it together

## what you'll find here (probably)

iâ€™ll be rambling about:

- front-end chaos: React, Next.js, Tailwind, TypeScript
- clean-ish systems: architecture, workflows, infra stuff
- dev tools i admire and swear by (until i donâ€™t)
- behind-the-scenes of building solo projects like **minderly** and the **chaos circuit**
- random brain dumps about tech, identity, and digital creativity

## a hello in code

hereâ€™s how i greet (or maybe just you):

```tsx
const HelloNik = ({ mood }) => {
  return (
    <section className="vibe-check">
      <h1>hey there ðŸ‘‹</h1>
      <p>todayâ€™s vibe: {mood || 'semi-chaotic but chill'}</p>
    </section>
  );
};
